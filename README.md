# Lofi Music Website

This project is a lofi music website built using React.js. It provides a soothing and relaxing experience for users who enjoy listening to lofi music. The website is designed to create a calming ambiance with its minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing interface. This project was inspired by my love of listening to lofi music from YouTube while coding.
